#here we are exploring loops

#for loop
# name = "anurag"

# for i in name:  #here we are printing each characters of a string
    # print(i)

# list = ["aluu", "pyazz", "tamatar"]

# for items in list: #here we are printing items of the list
#     print(items)

# range 

# for n in range(1, 5): #it will print from 1 to 4
    # print(n) 

# for n in range (0, 21, 4): # this is third parameter of range, here starts at 0, stops before 21 (exclusive), and increments by 4 for each number in the sequence
    # print(n)

#while loop

# i = 1
# while(i<=3):
#     print(i)
#     i = i+1
# else: print("loop isn't work") #this will print if the condition will not work or it will come out of the loop
